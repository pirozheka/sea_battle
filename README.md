# Battleship Game in Python

Dive into the classic game of Battleship. Engage in a naval strategy board game against the computer and test your mettle as you try to sink all enemy ships before they decimate your fleet.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `random`
- `time`

Both libraries are part of the Python Standard Library, so you shouldn't need to install anything extra.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pirozheka/battleship-game.git
```

### Step 2: Run the Game

Navigate to the cloned directory, and run the `app.py` file:

```bash
cd sea_battle
python app.py
```

## How to Play

Once you have started the game, you'll be prompted to input your moves in the console. The format for making a move is as follows:

1. Enter the row number (a digit) and press Enter.
2. Enter the column number (a digit) and press Enter.

For example:

```plaintext
3 [Enter]
5 [Enter]
```

This would target the cell at row 3, column 5.

## Important Notes

- On occasion, the board may not generate correctly. If this happens, simply restart the game a few times until the boards are generated properly.
- The game is played entirely in the console. No graphical interface is provided.

## Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue in the repository.
